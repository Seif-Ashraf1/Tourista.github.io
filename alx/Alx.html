            <p>
                The ancient theater of Alexandria, known as the Kom el Dikka theater, is a historical amphitheater
                located in Alexandria,
                Egypt. It dates back to the Roman period and is considered one of the most significant archaeological
                sites in the city.
                The theater was built during the Roman occupation of Egypt, likely in the 2nd century AD, and was part
                of a larger complex
                that included public baths and a small market,The theater follows the typical Roman design with a
                semicircular orchestra.

            <p>
                Cleopatra's underwater palace refers to the possible existence of a submerged palace or structure
                associated with Queen Cleopatra
                VII of Egypt. While there are historical references and legends about Cleopatra's lavish lifestyle and
                her connections to Alexandria's
                coastal areas, concrete evidence of an underwater palace directly linked to her remains elusive.Ancient
                texts and accounts mention
                Cleopatra's fondness for lavish living and her interest in maritime activities, leading to speculation
                about the existence of a grand
                palace or villa along the Mediterranean coast, possibly submerged over time.

        Art in Alexandria:
    </h3>
    <div class="audio">
        <p>
            Throughout the ages, Alexandria has been a vibrant nexus of art and culture, evolving from its ancient
            origins as a center of learning and intellectual
            pursuit to its modern-day status as a thriving hub of artistic expression. In antiquity, the city's famed
            Library of Alexandria attracted scholars
            and thinkers from around the world, fostering a rich tapestry of ideas and creativity. Under Hellenistic and
            Roman influence, Alexandria became a
            melting pot of diverse cultures, evident in its architectural marvels like the Serapeum and the Kom el Dikka
            theater, where dramatic performances and
            music flourished. Over the centuries, Byzantine, Islamic, and Renaissance influences further enriched
            Alexandria's artistic heritage, leading to the
            modern revival exemplified by the Bibliotheca Alexandrina. Today, Alexandria's contemporary art scene, with
            its galleries, festivals, and cultural
            events, continues to honor this legacy of artistic excellence and cultural diversity, making it a beacon of
            creativity that transcends time and borders.
