                Dahab’s wonderful versatility and relative remoteness are among the reasons people like Zein and Limonova have opted to remain here during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Social distancing is easier here,” explains Zein. “You are up in the mountains and when you go out, you are on your own.”

But although the influx of Egyptians moving from the city to Dahab may help the local economy in the short term, it also increases the risk of bringing the virus with them.

According to the Egyptian Health Ministry, there have been close to 40,000 Covid-19 infections in the country, with capital Cairo and the nearby provinces of Giza and Qalioubiya reporting the highest numbers.

                <strong>The Blue Hole</strong><br>
                ne of Dahab’s most famous sites, the Blue Hole is considered the world’s deadliest diving spot.

But its infamous reputation has only boosted the impressive sinkhole’s appeal to brave divers looking for an underwater Everest.

Descending to a maximum depth of 328 feet and easily accessible from the shore, the Blue Hole, is shielded from the currents, so its waters are relatively calm.

The conditions here are perfect for free divers keen to learn, as well as advanced divers looking to push their limits in a race against depth and lung capacity.

While it’s entirely possible to scuba dive safely in the Blue Hole, its notoriety is due to an infamous archway known as the Arch, which connects the site with the open sea.

Scuba divers who seek out the Arch.
