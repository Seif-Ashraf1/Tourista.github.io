                He was the son of Khafre and, according to the Turin papyrus, reigned for 18 (or 28) years. According to tradition, Menkaure was a pious and just king. Although his pyramid and mortuary temple were unfinished at his death, his successor, Shepseskaf, completed the stonework of the mortuary temple in brick.

                It was carved from the bedrock along the causeway that connected the Pyramid of Khafre to its Valley Temple. This makes it likely that it was carved during Khafre’s reign (c. 2558–2532 BC). It is also believed that the face of the Sphinx was based on Pharaoh Khafre’s own features.<br>
                The Sphinx faces from west to east and measures 73 meters (240 feet) long and 20 meters (66 feet) high. </p>

            <p><b>.</b> Saqqara pyramid also called <b>Zuser</b> Ṣaqqārah, part of the necropolis of the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis, 15 miles (24 km) southwest of Cairo and west of the modern Arab village of Ṣaqqārah. The site extends along the edge of the desert plateau for about 5 miles (8 km), bordering Abū Ṣīr to the north and Dahshūr to the south. In 1979 the ancient ruins of the Memphis area, including Ṣaqqārah, Abū Ṣīr, Dahshūr, Abū Ruwaysh, and the Pyramids of Giza, were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.<br>
              The earliest remains at Ṣaqqārah are those in the early dynastic cemetery at the northernmost end of the site, where large mud-brick tombs, or mastabas (Arabic: maṣṭabāt, singular maṣṭabah), have been found that date to the very beginning of Egyptian history.<br> Although storage jars found in the mastabas bore the names of the kings of the 1st dynasty (c. 2925–c. 2775 BCE), it seems that these tombs were those of high officials of the period.

A unique example of early pyramid development in Egypt, this was the second pyramid built by Sneferu.<br>The earlier one, because of its peculiar double slope, is variously called the Blunted, Bent, False, or Rhomboidal Pyramid. It represents an early attempt to build a true pyramid, but the initial angle of slope (52°) was found to be too steep; the top portion of the pyramid was thereupon reduced to 43.5°. The best-preserved of the five, it is the only Old Kingdom (c. 2575–c. 2130 BCE) pyramid with two entrances.
