                        Its height reaches 187 meters, which is about 43 meters higher than the Great Pyramid of Giza.
                         At the top of the Cairo Tower, there is a tourist restaurant on a revolving platform that takes
                          restaurant patrons to see the landmarks of Cairo from all sides.
                        The tower is considered one of the most prominent landmarks of Cairo.
                         It consists of 16 floors and stands on a base of
                        Aswan granite stones that were previously used by the ancient Egyptians in building their temples and tombs. The trip
                        inside the tower’s elevator to reach its end takes 45 seconds.
